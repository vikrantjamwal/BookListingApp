Book Listing App
====

### Project Overview
In this project the goal is to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. We will be using the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user. 

### Why this project?
This project gives the ability to practice how to get data from an api, which will be key in developing any app which makes use of a backend server, real time data, or interactions over the internet.

### What will I learn?
This project is about combining various ideas and skills. They include:

* Fetching data from an API
* Using an AsyncTask
* Parsing a JSON response
* Creating a list based on that data and displaying it to the user
